# ObjectPool_Custom

https://aiarcost.github.io/ObjectPool_Custom/

This is a project that shows how the object pool patterns works. This is based on David Baron's version of the object pool. I have changed this project such as:

 - Creating an Observer pattern for when the "Cannot spawn anymore objects" text should be set active or not 
 - Gave the objects a goal of following the mouse cursor
 - overall look and design of the layout of this scene


Questions: 

Q1: What are some game ideas that can use Object Pools?

Q2: Could there be a way to allow the user to choose how many objects of each type they have in their pool?

Q3: Would be adding to the object pool during runtime diminish the benefits of the object pool?
